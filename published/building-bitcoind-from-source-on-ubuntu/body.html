<p>First, you'll need to download the source code for the latest release of bitcoin; you can view a list of releases <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases">here</a>. You'll usually want to get the most recent stable release (which will just have numbers, no suffix).</p>

<p>An example of downloading the latest release at the time of writing this post:</p>
<pre class="code">
cd /usr/local/src;\
wget https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/archive/v0.9.2.tar.gz;
</pre>

<p>Extract the archive:</p>
<pre class="code">
cd /usr/local/src
tar -zxvf v0.9.2.tar.gz
</pre>


<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>To get <span class="code">add-apt-repository</span>, which we will use later to add the bitcoin PPA:</p>
<pre class="code">
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
</pre>

<p>Add the bitcoin PPA to get access to the <span class="code">libdb4.8++-dev</span> package:</p>
<pre class="code">
add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
apt-get update
</pre>

<p>Now you can install all the dependencies, including the build dependencies:</p>
<pre class="code">
apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install libtool autotools-dev autoconf
apt-get install libssl-dev
apt-get install libboost-all-dev libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev
apt-get install pkg-config
apt-get install bsdmainutils
</pre>
<p>If you're reading this from the future, you may want to check with the readme file(s) to verify that you have all the required dependencies; they may have changed since this article was written.</p>


<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Finally, it's time to build:</p>
<pre class="code">
cd /usr/local/src/bitcoin-0.9.2
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-cli=no --with-gui=no
make
</pre>
<p>This will take a little while. If you encounter errors during the build process, first try searching the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">bitcoin GitHub repo</a>. If you're reading this from the future, you may want to check with the readme file(s) to verify that you have all the required dependencies; they may have changed since this article was written.</p>

<p>After the build process has completed with no errors, you should end up with a bitcoind binary located at <span class="code">/usr/local/src/bitcoin-0.9.2/src/bitcoind</span>. Now it's time to move on to <a href="https://degreesofzero.com/article/installing-bitcoind-on-ubuntu.html">installing bitcoind on Ubuntu</a>.</p>
